## Getting Started

Clone the app

```
git clone https://github.com/dalexj/food_train.git/
cd food_train
```

Install the gems

```
bundle
```

This app uses Yelp API and Twitter OAuth,
so you'll need to gather the following keys
and set environment variables like so:

```
TWITTER_API_KEY
TWITTER_API_SECRET
YELP_CONSUMER_KEY
YELP_CONSUMER_SECRET
YELP_TOKEN
YELP_TOKEN_SECRET
```
